## Usage

### Start a Local Server

1. Install `http-server` globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

## Commands

### Install Dependencies
Install all required project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Build for Browser
Use `Browserify` to bundle the project for the browser:
```bash
npx browserify script.js -o bundle.js
```

### Run a Local Server
Start a lightweight HTTP server to serve the project:
```bash
http-server
```

### Audit for Vulnerabilities
Check for security vulnerabilities in your dependencies:
```bash
npm audit
```

### Update Dependencies
Update all dependencies to their latest versions:
```bash
npm update
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `http-server` Not Recognized
If you encounter:
```
http-server: command not found
```
Ensure `http-server` is installed globally and that the global `npm` binaries directory is in your system `PATH`.

Run:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

### Alternative Server Command
You can use `npx` to avoid global installation:
```bash
npx http-server
```
